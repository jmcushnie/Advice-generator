# Advice-generator
Frontend mentor challenge using HTML CSS JavaScript and Adice Slip API
This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out an advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to: 

- Click the dice button and return a random piece of advice with each click.
- See hover states for interactive elements on the page.
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

I worked with HTML and CSS to get the app to look like the design, using flexbox
to position content. Mobile-first and then used media queries for desktop.

I then worked on the button hover effect and added a box-shadow to achieve the glow effect.

Next i started with JavaScript and wrote a function that fetched the Advice Slip API, I then added this to the app using inner.HTML and added the function to the button on click.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to work with a 3rd-Party API and include it in the app.
